# LSTM Word Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for implementing an LSTM-based model to perform word prediction.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the next word in a sequence. It covers data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- LSTM model architecture
- Model training and validation
- Predictions and evaluation

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook lstm_predict.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells to train the LSTM model and generate word predictions.

## Results
The notebook provides evaluations of the predicted vs. actual words, helping to assess the model's performance.
