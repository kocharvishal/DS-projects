# LSTM Word Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for implementing an LSTM-based model to perform word prediction.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the next word in a sequence. It covers data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- LSTM model architecture
- Model training and validation
- Predictions and evaluation

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The notebook provides evaluations of the predicted vs. actual words, helping to assess the model's performance.
